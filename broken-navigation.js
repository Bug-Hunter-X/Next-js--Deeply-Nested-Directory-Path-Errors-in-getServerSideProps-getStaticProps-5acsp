In Next.js, a fairly uncommon error arises when using server-side props (`getServerSideProps`) or static generation (`getStaticProps`) within a deeply nested directory structure.  If the directory structure is excessively deep or contains oddly-named directories (including those with spaces or special characters), Next.js's file system traversal might fail, resulting in unexpected behavior such as 404 errors, or the function not being called at all.  This isn't typically a coding error, but rather a structural issue.
