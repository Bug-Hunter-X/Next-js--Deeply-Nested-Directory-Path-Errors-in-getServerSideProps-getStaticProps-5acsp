The solution lies in restructuring the project's directory hierarchy. Avoid excessively deep nesting and use simple, descriptive names for directories.  For instance, instead of:

`pages/a/very/deeply/nested/path/to/my/page.js`

Consider something flatter, like:

`pages/my-page.js`

or

`pages/deeply-nested/my-page.js` (only slightly nested)

Ensure directory names use only alphanumeric characters and underscores to avoid path resolution issues.  Correctly configuring `basePath` in your Next.js configuration (`next.config.js`) might also be necessary in very special cases, but restructuring the directories usually resolves the issue more directly.
